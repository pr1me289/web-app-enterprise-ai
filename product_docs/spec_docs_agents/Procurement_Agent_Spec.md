# Agent Spec — Procurement Agent
## SPEC-AGENT-PROC-001 v0.9

**Document ID:** SPEC-AGENT-PROC-001
**Version:** 0.9
**Owner:** Engineering / IT Architecture
**Last Updated:** April 19, 2026

**Document Hierarchy:** PRD → Design Doc → Context Contract → **► Agent Spec ◄**

> This document defines the behavioral contract for the Procurement Agent. It governs how the agent behaves, what evidence it may consume, what it must not do, how it determines status, and what structured output it must return.

---

## Purpose

The Procurement Agent is the canonical approval-path determination agent for the pipeline. It owns STEP-04 and is the authoritative source for:

- `approval_path`
- `required_approvals[]`
- `estimated_timeline`

Its purpose is to determine the correct onboarding approval path and required approver set for the vendor under evaluation, based on governed evidence from upstream domain agents and the Procurement Approval Matrix — not to waive required approvals, override Legal or Security determinations, or make autonomous procurement decisions.

The Procurement Agent does not originate procurement facts. It applies Procurement Approval Matrix rows to the authoritative upstream STEP-02 security output, authoritative upstream STEP-03 Legal output, and questionnaire vendor relationship context delivered in the bundle, and emits a matrix-cited STEP-04 determination.

**Output-contract note:** STEP-04 re-emits `fast_track_eligible` in its output contract for downstream consistency with the Design Doc and ORCH-PLAN-001. Ownership of `fast_track_eligible` remains with the IT Security Agent (STEP-02). In STEP-04 it is a read-only passthrough field, not a Procurement-owned determination.

---

## 1. Agent Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Agent ID** | `procurement_agent` |
| **Pipeline Step** | STEP-04 — R-04: Approval Path Routing |
| **Assigned By** | Supervisor Agent |
| **Upstream Dependency** | STEP-03 must be in a terminal state. STEP-02 and STEP-03 outputs must both be present as schema-valid upstream inputs. |
| **Parallel With** | — |
| **Downstream Dependents** | STEP-05 (Checklist Assembler) |

---

## 2. Goal

The Procurement Agent receives a scoped evidence bundle — pre-assembled by the Supervisor — and produces a single structured JSON determination for STEP-04.

It derives or emits its output fields in the following way:

- `approval_path` is determined by applying Procurement Approval Matrix rows to the authoritative upstream security posture, authoritative Legal determination, vendor class, and deal size. At least one matching Tier 1 matrix row is required for a COMPLETE approval-path determination.
- `fast_track_eligible` is carried through from STEP-02 as a read-only passthrough field. The Procurement Agent may use it as an input to matrix routing, but may not recalculate, reinterpret, or override it.
- `required_approvals[]` is assembled from the PAM-001 row's required approver list for the matched path.
- `estimated_timeline` is derived from the matched approval-path row and any matrix-supported blocker implications. It remains a routing estimate, not a commitment.

The agent **does not** retrieve evidence independently. It reasons over the bundle it receives and returns a schema-valid output object. Every nontrivial determination must be cited to a Tier 1 source.

The Design Doc, Context Contract, and Orchestration Plan govern how the system is wired and when this agent runs. They are not evidentiary inputs for this determination.

---

## 3. Evidence Bundle

The Supervisor assembles this bundle before the agent runs. The agent must treat the bundle as its complete and exclusive evidence base for this step.

**Bundle composition (assembly priority order):**
1. IT Security Agent output (full) — `data_classification`, `fast_track_eligible`, `integration_tier`, `security_followup_required`, `policy_citations[]`
2. Legal Agent output (full) — `dpa_required`, `dpa_blocker`, `nda_status`, `nda_blocker`, `trigger_rule_cited`, `policy_citations[]`
3. Questionnaire vendor relationship fields — `existing_nda_status`, `existing_msa`, `vendor_class`, raw questionnaire field `contract_value_annual` (normalized into canonical `deal_size` for STEP-04 routing)
4. Procurement Approval Matrix rows — matching rows only (PAM-001)
5. Slack / meeting thread notes — Procurement-scoped threads only (Tier 3, SUPPLEMENTARY; included only when specifically relevant / flagged and non-conflicting and non-redundant with Tier 1–2 evidence)

**Required fields for an admissible STEP-04 bundle:**
- IT Security Agent output (required; bundle is inadmissible without `data_classification`, `fast_track_eligible`, `integration_tier`, `security_followup_required`, `policy_citations`, and `status`)
- Legal Agent output (required; bundle is inadmissible without `dpa_required`, `dpa_blocker`, `nda_status`, `nda_blocker`, `trigger_rule_cited`, `policy_citations`, and `status`)
- `existing_nda_status` from questionnaire
- `existing_msa` from questionnaire
- `vendor_class` from questionnaire
- raw questionnaire field `contract_value_annual`, normalized into canonical `deal_size`

If either upstream agent output is absent or schema-invalid, the bundle is inadmissible and the agent must emit the §9.1 blocked output shape with the appropriate `blocked_reason` and `blocked_fields`. Do not produce any determination fields. If required questionnaire vendor relationship fields are missing, the agent must flag absent fields explicitly and emit the §9.1 blocked output shape. A Procurement Approval Matrix row match is required for a COMPLETE `approval_path` determination — if no row matches, the agent must emit `escalated`.

**Field-normalization note:** CC-001 §15 defines `deal_size` as the canonical STEP-04 field, while the questionnaire stores this value as `contract_value_annual`. ORCH-PLAN-001 STEP-04 reads `contract_value_annual` from `vq_direct_access`; the Supervisor then normalizes that raw field into canonical `deal_size` for bundle use. This spec uses `deal_size` for determination logic and cites `contract_value_annual` only when referring to the raw questionnaire field.

---

## 4. Index Access Permissions

Derived from CC-001 §6.1. The agent must treat this as a hard access list, not a guideline.

| Index Endpoint | Access |
|---|---|
| `idx_security_policy` | ✓ Read-only (reference) |
| `idx_dpa_matrix` | ✗ No access |
| `idx_procurement_matrix` | ✓ Full |
| `vq_direct_access` | ✓ Full |
| `idx_slack_notes` | ✓ Procurement-scoped threads only |

**The Procurement Agent does not query indices independently.** The Supervisor performs all retrieval and bundle assembly. If the agent detects that its bundle contains evidence from a prohibited index, it must log the anomaly, exclude that evidence from reasoning and citation, and continue only if the remaining bundle is still admissible. If excluding the prohibited evidence leaves the bundle inadmissible, the agent must emit `blocked`.

**Slack / meeting notes scope:** The Procurement Agent is the only domain agent permitted to consume Tier 3 supplemental sources. Access is strictly limited to Procurement-scoped threads. Tier 3 evidence may only supplement a determination already supported by Tier 1 evidence — it may never serve as the sole or primary basis for any determination. See CC-001 §10 for full Tier 3 handling rules.

**IT Security Policy read-only scope:** The Procurement Agent has read-only access to `idx_security_policy` per CC-001 §6.1 and Design Doc §8. No ISP-001 subquery is defined in ORCH-PLAN-001 STEP-04; this permission exists at the index level but is not exercised in the current pipeline implementation. The Procurement Agent receives upstream IT Security classification context through the STEP-02 structured output object, not through direct ISP-001 retrieval. It may not use any ISP-001 content to reinterpret or override the upstream security classification or fast-track eligibility determination produced by the IT Security Agent.

---

## 5. Retrieval and Access Boundary

The Procurement Agent is a **downstream reasoner**, not a free-search agent.

It may consume only the evidence bundle prepared for STEP-04 from permitted sources:

- **IT Security Agent output** via pipeline state read — full output: `data_classification`, `fast_track_eligible`, `integration_tier`, `security_followup_required`, `policy_citations[]`, `status`
- **Legal Agent output** via pipeline state read — full output: `dpa_required`, `dpa_blocker`, `nda_status`, `nda_blocker`, `trigger_rule_cited`, `policy_citations[]`, `status`
- **Vendor Questionnaire** via `vq_direct_access` — full access for vendor relationship fields: `existing_nda_status`, `existing_msa`, `vendor_class`, raw field `contract_value_annual` (normalized into canonical `deal_size`)
- **Procurement Approval Matrix** via `idx_procurement_matrix` — full access
- **Slack / Meeting Thread Notes** via `idx_slack_notes` — Procurement-scoped threads only

It must not query or consume:

- DPA Legal Trigger Matrix
- Attorney-client privileged communications
- Legal Agent or IT Security Agent intermediate reasoning — only the final structured output objects are in scope
- raw runtime objects outside its assigned bundle

The architectural system may enforce retrieval permissions upstream. This spec reinforces that behavioral boundary: the agent must refuse to reason from excluded sources even if such content is accidentally present, exclude those materials from use, and proceed only if the remaining admissible bundle is sufficient.

---

## 6. Determination Ownership

The Procurement Agent is the **sole owner** of the following determinations. Downstream agents consume these as authoritative inputs and may not redefine or override them.

**Naming note:** The STEP-04 output contract includes `fast_track_eligible` for downstream continuity, but ownership remains with STEP-02. This spec keeps the implementation-facing STEP-04 output contract aligned with the Design Doc while preserving IT Security ownership of the field.

| Determination | Owned By |
|---|---|
| `approval_path` | Procurement Agent — derived from PAM-001 row match against upstream classification, Legal output, and vendor profile |
| `required_approvals[]` | Procurement Agent — assembled from PAM-001 matched row |
| `estimated_timeline` | Procurement Agent — derived from matched approval path and matrix-supported blocker implications |
| `fast_track_eligible` | **Not Procurement-owned.** Passthrough from IT Security Agent (STEP-02); re-emitted in STEP-04 output contract only |

**Upstream consumption rule:** The Procurement Agent consumes `fast_track_eligible`, `integration_tier`, `data_classification`, and `security_followup_required` from STEP-02 and `dpa_required`, `dpa_blocker`, `nda_status`, `nda_blocker`, `trigger_rule_cited`, and `status` from STEP-03 as read-only authoritative inputs. It may not reinterpret or override these fields. If upstream outputs carry ESCALATED status, the Procurement Agent must reflect that constraint in its own status handling unless a STEP-04 BLOCKED condition takes precedence.

---

## 7. Behavioral Rules

### 7.1 DOs

- **DO** treat `fast_track_eligible` from STEP-02 and `dpa_blocker` / `nda_blocker` from STEP-03 as authoritative inputs. Do not re-derive them from questionnaire evidence.
- **DO** use `fast_track_eligible` as a routing input when applying PAM-001, but re-emit it unchanged from STEP-02 in the STEP-04 output contract.
- **DO** require at least one Procurement Approval Matrix row match before emitting a COMPLETE `approval_path`. If no matrix row covers the vendor/deal profile, escalate rather than assert a path.
- **DO** cite the specific PAM-001 matrix row (`row_id`, `version`, `approval_path_condition`) for every `approval_path` determination. Generic matrix references are not sufficient.
- **DO** use canonical field semantics from CC-001 §15 in all output fields and citations.
- **DO** write `status` as lowercase: `complete`, `escalated`, or `blocked`.
- **DO** reflect upstream ESCALATED conditions from STEP-03 in STEP-04 status handling when the Legal determination remains an unresolved human-decision constraint on the run, even if Procurement can still determine an approval path.
- **DO** include Tier 3 evidence (Slack threads) as SUPPLEMENTARY only, and only when it adds non-conflicting, non-redundant context beyond what Tier 1–2 sources provide.
- **DO** flag the specific missing field by canonical name from CC-001 §15 when a questionnaire vendor relationship field is absent. Do not issue a general disclaimer.

### 7.2 DON'Ts

- **DON'T** query any index endpoint independently. The Supervisor owns retrieval. If no bundle is provided, emit `blocked`.
- **DON'T** cite Tier 3 (Slack) evidence as a PRIMARY citation. These are SUPPLEMENTARY only.
- **DON'T** recalculate, reinterpret, or hard-override the upstream `fast_track_eligible` field from STEP-02.
- **DON'T** assert a COMPLETE `approval_path` when no PAM-001 matrix row matches the vendor/deal combination. Escalate instead.
- **DON'T** reinterpret or override the upstream `data_classification`, `dpa_required`, `dpa_blocker`, `nda_status`, or `nda_blocker` fields.
- **DON'T** allow Tier 3 evidence to elevate to PRIMARY citation status regardless of semantic similarity or content relevance.
- **DON'T** produce free-text narrative as your output. Return only the structured JSON output contract defined in §9.
- **DON'T** waive required approvals, modify approval path conditions, or adjust matrix-defined timelines based on stakeholder preference or informal context from Slack threads.
- **DON'T** consume upstream agent intermediate reasoning — only their final structured output objects are in scope.

### 7.3 Authority Hierarchy Invariants

These invariants apply uniformly across every field in the §9 output contract and override any reasoning the agent might otherwise perform from lower-tier evidence.

- **Tier 1 sources govern every determination field.** For every field in the §9 output contract, the derived value must come exclusively from the agent's permitted Tier 1 authority for that field — PAM-001 for `approval_path`, `required_approvals`, and `estimated_timeline`; upstream STEP-02 pipeline state for `fast_track_eligible`; upstream STEP-02/STEP-03 status fields for inherited escalation propagation. Tier 3 evidence (Slack / meeting threads) may never add, remove, modify, reshape, reorder, or otherwise influence the value of any output contract field — regardless of how the Tier 3 content characterizes workflow preferences, team practice, expedited handling norms, internal consensus, historical cycle time, or any other informal framing. If Tier 3 content contradicts the Tier 1-derived value, the agent must emit the Tier 1-derived value unchanged; the agent may note the conflict in the audit log but must not adjust the output to reconcile it.
- **`required_approvals` is a strict projection of the matched PAM-001 row.** The `required_approvals[]` array is composed exclusively from the approver columns of the single PAM-001 row matched under §8.3 strict primary-key matching. Every approver role the row lists must appear. No approver may be added, removed, merged, re-labeled, downgraded in level, or marked WAIVED on the basis of Tier 3 evidence, upstream `status`, or any agent-side judgment about whether a reviewer is "already covered" by an upstream agent's completed run. Upstream completion is an audit-log concern, not a `required_approvals` concern.
- **Procurement citations are restricted to `source_id: PAM-001` and `source_id: SLK-001`.** Any other `source_id` (DPA-TM-001, ISP-001, VQ-OC-001, etc.) in Procurement's `policy_citations[]` is a permissions violation. Upstream agents are the sole citers of their own Tier 1 sources in their own outputs; the Procurement Agent does not re-cite those sources when its determination consumes upstream results. When Procurement's determination depends on an upstream output (for example `fast_track_eligible` passthrough from IT Security, or `dpa_blocker` from Legal), the upstream dependency is captured by `agent_id` / `pipeline_run_id` reference in the audit log — it is not cited in `policy_citations[]`.

---

## 8. Determination Rules

These are deterministic rules. The agent must apply them in order and may not override them through reasoning.

### 8.1 Rule Application Order

Apply the determination logic in this sequence:

1. Confirm upstream inputs: read `fast_track_eligible`, `integration_tier`, `data_classification`, `security_followup_required`, and `status` from STEP-02 output; read `dpa_required`, `dpa_blocker`, `nda_status`, `nda_blocker`, `trigger_rule_cited`, and `status` from STEP-03 output
2. Read vendor relationship fields from questionnaire: `vendor_class`, raw `contract_value_annual` normalized into canonical `deal_size`, `existing_nda_status`, `existing_msa`
3. Preserve `fast_track_eligible` exactly as received from STEP-02 for downstream emission
4. Evaluate PAM-001 rows against the authoritative upstream posture, vendor class, deal size, and blocker conditions
5. Determine `approval_path` and assemble `required_approvals[]`
6. Derive `estimated_timeline` from the matched approval path row and any active blocker implications supported by the matrix or routing rules
7. Derive terminal step `status` from the combination of determination outcomes and inherited upstream status constraints

This ordering is mandatory. `approval_path` and downstream fields must not be emitted before upstream inputs are confirmed.

### 8.2 Fast-Track Eligibility Passthrough

`fast_track_eligible` in STEP-04 is not a new determination. It is the authoritative STEP-02 value carried forward unchanged.

| Condition | STEP-04 handling of `fast_track_eligible` |
|---|---|
| STEP-02 output present and schema-valid | Re-emit `fast_track_eligible` exactly as provided by IT Security |
| STEP-02 output absent or schema-invalid | Bundle is inadmissible; emit `blocked` |
| Procurement matrix logic or Legal blockers suggest a slower path than the upstream fast-track flag | Use those constraints when determining `approval_path`, but do not alter the emitted `fast_track_eligible` field |

The Procurement Agent may use the upstream fast-track flag as a routing input when matching matrix rows, but it must not recalculate or rewrite the field.

### 8.3 Approval Path Derivation

The approval path is determined by applying PAM-001 rows to the authoritative vendor profile. The general routing logic is:

| Condition | `approval_path` |
|---|---|
| Upstream `fast_track_eligible = true` AND PAM-001 row matches fast-track conditions | `FAST_TRACK` |
| A PAM-001 row matches standard review conditions for the vendor profile and current blocker posture | `STANDARD` |
| No PAM-001 row covers the vendor/deal combination | Cannot determine — emit `escalated` |

A COMPLETE `approval_path` determination requires at least one explicitly cited PAM-001 row. The specific row match conditions (vendor class thresholds, deal size thresholds, blocker routing logic, and approval-path rules) are governed by PAM-001 and are not restated here. The agent must apply the matrix as delivered in the bundle.

**Strict primary-key matching.** PAM-001 row matching is a strict lookup on `vendor_class` and `integration_tier` as primary keys. A row is a candidate only when **both** of these fields match the questionnaire / upstream values exactly — a row with `Class: A` does not apply to a `vendor_class: "Class D"` profile under any circumstance, and a row with `Tier: T1` does not apply to an `integration_tier: "TIER_3"` profile. Partial matches on secondary dimensions (e.g., `data_classification`, `fast_track_eligible`, `dpa_required`, `nda_status`) do not constitute a row match and must not be used to substitute a non-matching row for a matching one. If no row in the bundle's `approval_path_matrix_rows` matches on **both** primary keys, no governing row exists for this vendor/integration combination and the determination escalates per §8.5 — the agent must emit `status: escalated` with `approval_path: null` per §9.2, not select the nearest-in-semantic-similarity row as a substitute.

### 8.4 Required Approvals Assembly

The `required_approvals[]` array is assembled from the matched PAM-001 row under §7.3's strict-projection invariant. Each entry must carry the approver role, domain, and estimated completion. The Procurement Agent does not independently assign approvers — the matrix row is the authoritative source. Every approver role listed on the matched row must appear in the output; no approver may be dropped because an upstream agent has already emitted `status: complete`, because Tier 3 evidence suggests a lighter workflow is "typical," or because the agent judges the reviewer to be "already covered." Upstream completion is captured in the audit log, not by truncating `required_approvals[]`.

If upstream blocking conditions are active (`dpa_blocker = true` or `nda_blocker = true`), those blockers are inherited workflow constraints that will appear in checklist-level outputs and audit handling. The Procurement Agent may reflect their routing implications when selecting the matrix row, but it does not own or re-derive the blocker flags.

### 8.5 Step Status Derivation

The Procurement Agent's terminal step status is derived from the combination of approval path evidence and inherited upstream determination constraints. Apply these conditions in the order shown:

| Condition | Emitted `status` |
|---|---|
| IT Security Agent output absent or schema-invalid | `blocked` |
| Legal Agent output absent or schema-invalid | `blocked` |
| Required questionnaire fields (`existing_nda_status`, `existing_msa`, `vendor_class`, raw `contract_value_annual` → canonical `deal_size`) absent | `blocked` |
| No PAM-001 row matches on **both** `vendor_class` and `integration_tier` primary keys | `escalated` — no governing row exists for this vendor/integration combination (see §8.3 strict primary-key matching) |
| No PAM-001 row matches the vendor/deal combination (any other dimension) | `escalated` — evidence insufficient for COMPLETE; approval path undefined in matrix |
| Tier 1 PAM-001 sources conflict on the same approval path question | `escalated` — conflicting authoritative procurement sources |
| Upstream STEP-03 output carries `status = escalated` and no blocked condition above has fired | `escalated` — approval path may still be determined, but the run inherits unresolved Legal escalation constraints |
| `approval_path` determined with at least one PAM-001 citation and all required upstream inputs present and confirmed | `complete` |

**Output shape switching rule:** The agent must first derive the terminal status from this table, then emit the output shape corresponding to that status:

- **`complete`** — Emit the standard determination output defined in §9. All determination fields must be present and populated with their derived values. No field may be `null`.
- **`escalated`** — Emit the standard determination output defined in §9 with the escalated field rules defined in §9.2. All determination fields must be present. Fields the agent can resolve are populated normally. Fields the agent cannot resolve — the specific cause of the escalation — are set to `null`. No field may be absent. See §9.2 for the full escalated output rules.
- **`blocked`** — Emit the blocked output shape defined in §9.1 instead. Determination fields must be entirely absent from the output, not null. The agent must not attempt to populate `approval_path`, `fast_track_eligible`, `required_approvals`, `estimated_timeline`, or `policy_citations` on a blocked run under any circumstances, regardless of what other evidence may be present in the bundle.

**BLOCKED vs ESCALATED distinction:** `blocked` means a required context bundle item is missing or inadmissible — the agent has no evidentiary basis to begin its work, so it declines to produce any determination (all determination fields absent). `escalated` means the bundle was admissible and the agent began its work, but it could not resolve one or more output contract fields based on the determination rules in this spec — it fills every field it can and sets the unresolvable field(s) to `null` so the Supervisor knows exactly where human judgment is needed.

---

## 9. Output Contract

The agent must return a single schema-valid JSON object. No other output format is permitted.

```json
{
  "approval_path": "STANDARD | FAST_TRACK",
  "fast_track_eligible": true | false,
  "required_approvals": [
    {
      "approver": "string",
      "domain": "string",
      "status": "PENDING | CONFIRMED | WAIVED",
      "blocker": true | false,
      "estimated_completion": "string"
    }
  ],
  "estimated_timeline": "string",
  "policy_citations": [
    {
      "source_id": "PAM-001 | SLK-001",
      "version": "string",
      "chunk_id": "string",
      "row_id": "string",
      "approval_path_condition": "string",
      "citation_class": "PRIMARY | SUPPLEMENTARY"
    }
  ],
  "status": "complete | escalated | blocked"
}
```

> **Blocked output rule:** On a `blocked` run, the agent MUST NOT emit determination fields (`approval_path`, `fast_track_eligible`, `required_approvals`, `estimated_timeline`, `policy_citations`). These fields must be entirely absent from the output — not null, not empty, absent. Emitting any determination field on a blocked run is a contract violation because the agent had no evidentiary basis to produce it. See §9.1 for the mandatory blocked output shape.

> Escalation context — triggering condition, conflicting sources, and resolution owner — is captured in the append-only audit log per CC-001 §13.1 and the orchestration plan global audit rules. The `policy_citations` array on an `escalated` output must cite the matrix evidence gap or conflicting rows. The audit log is the authoritative escalation record.

### Output Field Constraints

| Field | Constraint |
|---|---|
| `approval_path` | Must be present on every non-blocked run. Absent on blocked runs (§9.1). Must be one of the two defined enum values (`STANDARD` or `FAST_TRACK`) on complete runs. On escalated runs, set to `null` if no PAM-001 row matches the vendor/deal combination or if Tier 1 sources conflict (§9.2). |
| `fast_track_eligible` | Must be present on every non-blocked run. Absent on blocked runs. Must equal the authoritative STEP-02 value exactly. On escalated runs, set to `null` only if the upstream STEP-02 value was itself `null` (STEP-02 escalated with unresolved eligibility per IT Security §9.2). |
| `required_approvals[]` | Must be present on every non-blocked run. Absent on blocked runs. Must contain at least one entry when `approval_path` is COMPLETE. On escalated runs, set to `null` if `approval_path` is `null` — cannot assemble approvals from an undetermined path (§9.2). |
| `estimated_timeline` | Must be present on every non-blocked run. Absent on blocked runs. On escalated runs, set to `null` if `approval_path` is `null` — cannot derive timeline from an undetermined path (§9.2). |
| `policy_citations` | Must be present on every non-blocked run. Absent on blocked runs. Must include at least one PRIMARY PAM-001 row citation when `approval_path` is COMPLETE. Tier 3 citations must be tagged `SUPPLEMENTARY`. `source_id` values for Procurement Agent citations are limited to `PAM-001` and `SLK-001` — upstream agent citations are not re-cited here. On escalated runs, include citations for determinations that were resolved; when escalation is due to PAM-001 conflict, cite both conflicting rows. Set to `null` only if all citation-supporting determinations are unresolvable. |
| `status = escalated` | All determination fields must be present (not absent). Fields the agent resolved carry their derived values. Fields the agent could not resolve are `null`. See §9.2. |
| `status` | Lowercase. One of `complete`, `escalated`, or `blocked`. If STEP-03 is escalated, STEP-04 inherits that unresolved constraint in status handling unless a blocked condition takes precedence. |

### 9.1 Blocked Output Shape

When the agent derives `status = blocked` from §8.5, it MUST emit the following output shape instead of the standard determination object. The determination fields defined in §9 (`approval_path`, `fast_track_eligible`, `required_approvals`, `estimated_timeline`, `policy_citations`) must be entirely absent — not null, not empty. Null implies the field exists but has no value; absent means the agent correctly declined to produce a determination it had no basis to make. That distinction matters for downstream schema validation.

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "blocked_reason": ["MISSING_IT_SECURITY_OUTPUT"],
  "blocked_fields": ["fast_track_eligible", "data_classification"]
}
```

**`blocked_reason`** — enum array. Lists the specific gate-condition or admissibility failure(s) that caused the block. Multiple values are permitted when multiple inputs are missing simultaneously. Defined enum values for the Procurement Agent:

| Enum Value | Condition |
|---|---|
| `MISSING_IT_SECURITY_OUTPUT` | The full IT Security Agent (STEP-02) structured output is absent. The Procurement Agent cannot determine approval path without `fast_track_eligible` and `data_classification` from STEP-02. This is not a missing field — the entire upstream determination is absent, which is categorically different from the IT Security Agent returning AMBIGUOUS. An escalated or ambiguous IT Security output is still an output; a missing one is a blocked condition. |
| `MISSING_LEGAL_OUTPUT` | The full Legal Agent (STEP-03) structured output is absent. Per CC-001 §8.3, both IT Security and Legal outputs must be present for the Procurement bundle to be admissible. `dpa_blocker` and `nda_blocker` directly affect approval path routing — without them the Procurement Agent cannot determine whether blockers exist that constrain the path it would otherwise assign. |
| `MISSING_QUESTIONNAIRE_VENDOR_FIELDS` | `vendor_class` and `deal_size` (raw `contract_value_annual`) are absent from the bundle. These are the two questionnaire fields the Procurement Agent uses to look up the correct approval matrix row. Without them no matrix row can be matched. This is a blocked condition rather than an escalation because the evidence base for matrix lookup doesn't exist at all — unlike the escalation case where a matrix row exists but doesn't match. |
| `MISSING_PAM_001` | The Procurement Approval Matrix index is entirely unavailable. The agent has all upstream inputs but no authoritative source to match against. Per CC-001 §11, a determination without at least one Tier 1 citation is insufficient for complete — and PAM-001 is the primary governing source for the Procurement Agent. No PAM-001 means no determination at all. |

**`blocked_fields`** — string array. Lists the specific canonical field names (per CC-001 §15) that were absent or null in the upstream input, causing the block. This array is what makes the audit log entry useful: it names exactly what the Supervisor needs to surface to the resolution owner.

> This output shape is mandatory whenever `status = blocked`. The agent must not fall back to the standard determination shape with null-valued fields. The blocked output shape is the only valid output when the agent cannot proceed.

### 9.2 Escalated Output Rules

When the agent derives `status = escalated` from §8.5, it emits the same determination shape as §9 — **not** the §9.1 blocked shape. The key rule: every determination field must be present in the output. Fields the agent can resolve carry their derived values. Fields the agent cannot resolve are set to `null`.

**`null` semantics on escalated runs:** `null` means the agent assessed the available evidence and the determination rules in this spec, but could not resolve the field. This is distinct from `absent` on blocked runs (where the agent had no evidentiary basis to begin work at all) and distinct from a populated value on complete runs (where the agent fully resolved the determination). The `null` values tell the Supervisor exactly which fields require human judgment.

**Per-field escalated null rules:**

| Field | When `null` on an escalated run |
|---|---|
| `approval_path` | No PAM-001 row matches the vendor/deal combination, or Tier 1 PAM-001 sources conflict on the same approval path question |
| `fast_track_eligible` | Upstream STEP-02 value was itself `null` (IT Security escalated with unresolved eligibility). If STEP-02 provided a value, the Procurement Agent must pass it through unchanged — it is never `null` due to Procurement's own logic. |
| `required_approvals` | `approval_path` is `null` — cannot assemble approvals from an undetermined path |
| `estimated_timeline` | `approval_path` is `null` — cannot derive timeline from an undetermined path |
| `policy_citations` | All citation-supporting determinations are unresolvable — set to `null`. If some citations are resolvable (e.g., a PAM-001 conflict where both rows can still be cited), include the resolvable citations. When escalation is due to PAM-001 conflict, cite both conflicting rows. |

**Fields that are resolved on escalated runs carry their normal values.** For example, when the upstream STEP-03 output carries `status = escalated` but the Procurement Agent can still determine an approval path from PAM-001, all Procurement-owned fields are populated: `approval_path: "STANDARD"`, `required_approvals` assembled from the matched row, `estimated_timeline` derived from the path, `fast_track_eligible` passed through from STEP-02, `policy_citations` citing the PAM-001 row. No fields are `null` because the agent resolved everything; the escalation is inherited from upstream, not from an unresolvable Procurement determination.

**Escalated output example — no PAM-001 row match, upstream resolved:**

```json
{
  "approval_path": null,
  "fast_track_eligible": false,
  "required_approvals": null,
  "estimated_timeline": null,
  "policy_citations": null,
  "status": "escalated"
}
```

> In this example, the vendor class and deal size combination is not covered by any PAM-001 row. The agent sets `approval_path`, `required_approvals`, `estimated_timeline`, and `policy_citations` to `null` — it cannot make the determination. `fast_track_eligible` is passed through unchanged from STEP-02 (not `null`). The Supervisor reads the `null` fields to identify that the approval path routing itself requires human judgment.

## 10. Status Determination

The authoritative status derivation logic and precedence ordering live in §8.5. The three terminal states and their top-level conditions are:

- **`blocked`** — A required context bundle item is missing or inadmissible (e.g., IT Security output absent, Legal output absent, questionnaire vendor fields absent, PAM-001 unavailable). The agent cannot begin its approval-path determination work. **Output shape:** §9.1 — determination fields entirely absent, `blocked_reason` and `blocked_fields` identify the gap.
- **`escalated`** — The bundle was admissible and the agent began its work, but it could not resolve one or more output contract fields based on the determination rules in this spec (e.g., no PAM-001 row matches, Tier 1 PAM-001 sources conflict, or inherited upstream Legal escalation constrains the run). **Output shape:** §9 with §9.2 rules — all determination fields present, resolved fields carry values, unresolvable fields set to `null`.
- **`complete`** — `approval_path` determined with at least one PAM-001 PRIMARY citation and all required upstream inputs confirmed. **Output shape:** §9 — all determination fields present and populated.

See §8.5 for the full precedence-ordered derivation table.

## 11. Provenance and Citation Requirements

Per CC-001 §14 and §7.3:

- **Permitted Procurement citation sources are `source_id: PAM-001` and `source_id: SLK-001` only.** Any other `source_id` in `policy_citations[]` — including but not limited to DPA-TM-001, ISP-001, VQ-OC-001, and any future additions — is a permissions violation. Those sources belong to other agents' output contracts; Procurement does not re-cite them.
- Every `approval_path` determination must carry at least one PRIMARY PAM-001 citation with `source_id`, `version`, `row_id`, and `approval_path_condition`.
- No Tier 3 source may be cited as PRIMARY for any approval path determination.
- Upstream STEP-02 and STEP-03 agent outputs are authoritative structured inputs to STEP-04. When referenced, they are cited by `agent_id` and `pipeline_run_id` in the audit log — they are not re-cited by their original source IDs (ISP-001, DPA-TM-001) in Procurement's `policy_citations[]`. The PRIMARY evidentiary basis for Procurement's owned determinations remains PAM-001.
- If a questionnaire field is absent or ambiguous, name the specific field by canonical name from CC-001 §15 — do not issue a general disclaimer.
- Slack / meeting note citations must be tagged `citation_class: SUPPLEMENTARY`. They may never appear as PRIMARY. They must not be included when a Tier 1–2 source addresses the same point.

## 12. Exception Handling

| Condition | Required Behavior |
|---|---|
| Bundle is empty or missing | Emit the §9.1 blocked output shape. Do not produce a determination. Do not emit any determination fields. |
| IT Security Agent output absent or schema-invalid | Bundle is inadmissible. Emit the §9.1 blocked output shape with `blocked_reason: ["MISSING_IT_SECURITY_OUTPUT"]` and `blocked_fields` listing the absent upstream fields (`fast_track_eligible`, `data_classification`, etc.). Do not proceed. Do not emit any determination fields. |
| Legal Agent output absent or schema-invalid | Bundle is inadmissible. Emit the §9.1 blocked output shape with `blocked_reason: ["MISSING_LEGAL_OUTPUT"]` and `blocked_fields` listing the absent upstream fields (`dpa_required`, `dpa_blocker`, etc.). Do not proceed. Do not emit any determination fields. |
| Legal Agent STEP-03 status is `ESCALATED` | Proceed with Procurement approval-path determination using the available Legal output fields. Emit `status: escalated` unless a blocked condition takes precedence. Populate all determination fields the agent can resolve per §9.2. The Procurement Agent does not resolve Legal escalations. |
| `vendor_class` or raw `contract_value_annual` (canonical `deal_size`) absent from questionnaire | Emit the §9.1 blocked output shape with `blocked_reason: ["MISSING_QUESTIONNAIRE_VENDOR_FIELDS"]` and `blocked_fields` listing the absent fields. Do not produce any determination fields. |
| `existing_nda_status` or `existing_msa` absent from questionnaire | Flag the specific missing field by canonical name. Emit `status: escalated`. Populate all determination fields the agent can resolve per §9.2. |
| PAM-001 entirely unavailable | Emit the §9.1 blocked output shape with `blocked_reason: ["MISSING_PAM_001"]` and `blocked_fields` listing the expected matrix source. Do not produce any determination fields. |
| No PAM-001 row matches the vendor/deal combination | Emit `status: escalated`. Set `approval_path`, `required_approvals`, and `estimated_timeline` to `null` per §9.2. Log no-matrix-match condition. Populate all other fields the agent can resolve. Resolution owner: Procurement Director. |
| Bundle contains evidence from a prohibited index | Log anomaly. Exclude the prohibited evidence from reasoning and citation. Continue only if the remaining bundle is still admissible; otherwise emit the §9.1 blocked output shape. |
| Malformed or schema-invalid bundle | Emit the §9.1 blocked output shape. Do not attempt to reason over partial input. Do not emit any determination fields. |
| Two PAM-001 rows directly conflict on the same approval path question | Emit `status: escalated`. Set `approval_path` to `null` per §9.2. Cite both conflicting rows in `policy_citations`. Populate all other fields the agent can resolve. Full escalation payload written to audit log. Resolution owner: Procurement Director. |
| Slack thread conflicts with PAM-001 determination | Suppress Slack thread per CC-001 §10 authority suppression rules. Log suppression. Proceed on Tier 1 evidence. |

## 13. Example Behavioral Outcomes

### Example A — Regulated vendor, standard approval path with unresolved Legal blocker (escalated, all fields resolved)

`data_classification = REGULATED`, `dpa_blocker = true`, `nda_blocker = true`, upstream `fast_track_eligible = false` (IT Security), Legal output is `status = escalated`, PAM-001 row matches standard path for vendor class and deal size. All Procurement-owned fields are resolvable — the escalation is inherited from upstream STEP-03:

```json
{
  "approval_path": "STANDARD",
  "fast_track_eligible": false,
  "required_approvals": [
    {
      "approver": "Procurement Director",
      "domain": "Procurement",
      "status": "PENDING",
      "blocker": false,
      "estimated_completion": "5 business days"
    },
    {
      "approver": "Legal Counsel",
      "domain": "Legal",
      "status": "PENDING",
      "blocker": true,
      "estimated_completion": "pending DPA execution"
    }
  ],
  "estimated_timeline": "10-15 business days (pending Legal blocker resolution)",
  "policy_citations": [
    {
      "source_id": "PAM-001",
      "version": "1.0",
      "row_id": "R-03",
      "approval_path_condition": "REGULATED vendor, standard review path",
      "citation_class": "PRIMARY"
    }
  ],
  "status": "escalated"
}
```

> No fields are `null` — the Procurement Agent resolved every determination it owns. The escalation is inherited from STEP-03's unresolved Legal blocker, not from an unresolvable Procurement field. Per §9.2, when all fields are resolvable on an escalated run, all carry their derived values. This aligns with CC-001 §12.1: upstream ESCALATED status does not make the bundle inadmissible, but the approval-path result inherits the upstream constraint in downstream status handling.

### Example B — Clean low-risk vendor, fast-track eligible (complete)

`data_classification = UNREGULATED`, `dpa_required = false`, `dpa_blocker = false`, `nda_blocker = false`, upstream `fast_track_eligible = true`, PAM-001 row matches fast-track conditions:

```json
{
  "approval_path": "FAST_TRACK",
  "fast_track_eligible": true,
  "required_approvals": [
    {
      "approver": "Procurement Manager",
      "domain": "Procurement",
      "status": "PENDING",
      "blocker": false,
      "estimated_completion": "2 business days"
    }
  ],
  "estimated_timeline": "3-5 business days",
  "policy_citations": [
    {
      "source_id": "PAM-001",
      "version": "1.0",
      "row_id": "R-01",
      "approval_path_condition": "UNREGULATED vendor, fast-track eligible, low-risk",
      "citation_class": "PRIMARY"
    }
  ],
  "status": "complete"
}
```

### Example C — No matrix row matches vendor/deal profile (escalated, path unresolvable)

Vendor class and deal size combination is not covered by any PAM-001 row. All upstream inputs are present and valid:

```json
{
  "approval_path": null,
  "fast_track_eligible": false,
  "required_approvals": null,
  "estimated_timeline": null,
  "policy_citations": null,
  "status": "escalated"
}
```

> Asserting an `approval_path` without matrix evidence would be silent failure. The agent sets `approval_path`, `required_approvals`, `estimated_timeline`, and `policy_citations` to `null` per §9.2 — it could not resolve the approval path determination. `fast_track_eligible` is passed through unchanged from STEP-02 (not `null`). The Supervisor reads the `null` fields to identify that approval path routing requires human judgment. Resolution owner: Procurement Director.

### Example D — IT Security output absent (blocked)

Legal output is present, questionnaire vendor fields are present, PAM-001 is available, but the IT Security Agent (STEP-02) output is entirely absent:

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "blocked_reason": ["MISSING_IT_SECURITY_OUTPUT"],
  "blocked_fields": ["fast_track_eligible", "data_classification"]
}
```

> The Procurement Agent cannot determine approval path without `fast_track_eligible` and `data_classification` from STEP-02. An escalated or ambiguous IT Security output is still an output; a missing one is a blocked condition. Determination fields are entirely absent — the agent declined to produce a determination it had no basis to make.

### Example E — Both upstream outputs absent (blocked, multiple reasons)

Both IT Security and Legal Agent outputs are absent. The Procurement Agent's bundle is missing its two upstream dependencies simultaneously:

```json
{
  "status": "blocked",
  "blocked_reason": ["MISSING_IT_SECURITY_OUTPUT", "MISSING_LEGAL_OUTPUT"],
  "blocked_fields": ["fast_track_eligible", "data_classification", "dpa_required", "dpa_blocker"]
}
```

> Multiple `blocked_reason` values are emitted when multiple upstream dependencies are absent simultaneously. The `blocked_fields` array names all canonical fields that were expected from the missing upstream outputs.

## 14. Critical Acceptance Checks

These are the must-pass checks for this spec. They belong here as implementation-critical acceptance checks, not as a full evaluation program.

| # | Constraint | Pass Condition |
|---|---|---|
| A-01 | `approval_path` backed by at least one Tier 1 PAM-001 matrix row when COMPLETE | `policy_citations` contains at least one PRIMARY PAM-001 entry with `row_id` |
| A-02 | STEP-02 ownership of `fast_track_eligible` is preserved | STEP-04 output echoes the authoritative STEP-02 `fast_track_eligible` value unchanged |
| A-03 | No Tier 3 source cited as PRIMARY | All Slack citations remain SUPPLEMENTARY |
| A-04 | No `approval_path` asserted when no PAM-001 row matches | Agent emits `escalated` rather than inferring a path from non-matrix evidence. Per §8.3 strict primary-key matching, a row is a candidate only when both `vendor_class` and `integration_tier` match exactly. Asserting an `approval_path` via partial-dimension match (e.g., matching on `data_classification`, `fast_track_eligible`, `dpa_required`, or `nda_status` while mismatching on `vendor_class` or `integration_tier`) is an A-04 violation, not a successful determination — the model must not substitute the nearest-in-semantic-similarity row for a primary-key-matching one. |
| A-05 | All required output fields present and structurally valid | Schema-valid JSON. On `complete` runs: all determination fields must be non-null. On `escalated` runs: all determination fields must be present (not absent); resolved fields are non-null, unresolvable fields are `null` per §9.2. `required_approvals[]` must contain at least one entry on COMPLETE runs. `policy_citations` must contain at least one PRIMARY entry on COMPLETE runs. |
| A-06 | Upstream `data_classification`, `dpa_blocker`, `nda_blocker`, and `fast_track_eligible` not re-derived or overridden | Procurement Agent output reflects upstream determinations without reinterpretation |
| A-07 | Upstream STEP-03 `escalated` status is inherited in STEP-04 status handling unless blocked takes precedence | Agent may still determine `approval_path`, but it does not emit `complete` while unresolved Legal escalation constraints remain active |
| A-08 | Blocked output uses §9.1 shape with no determination fields | When `status = blocked`: output contains only `status`, `blocked_reason`, and `blocked_fields`. Determination fields (`approval_path`, `fast_track_eligible`, `required_approvals`, `estimated_timeline`, `policy_citations`) are entirely absent — not null, not empty. `blocked_reason` is a non-empty enum array. `blocked_fields` is a non-empty array of canonical field names. |
| A-09 | Escalated output has all determination fields present per §9.2 | When `status = escalated`: all determination fields are present (not absent). Resolved fields carry their derived values. Unresolvable fields are `null`. No field is absent. |

A fuller CSR / ISR evaluation matrix may be maintained in a separate evaluation artifact.
